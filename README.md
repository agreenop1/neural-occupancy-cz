# neural-occupancy-cz
Test neural network occupancy models for citizen science. 
First part: simple logistic regression using optimizer. 

Second part: occupancy model (latent state) using optimizer. 

Third part: Neural network for occupancy model (simple)

Fourth part: Dynamic occupancy model (testing effects of missing data).

All under development..
