# neural-occupancy-cz
Test neural network occupancy models for citizen science. 

First part: simple logistic regression using optimizer. 

Second part: occupancy model (latent state) using optimizer. 

Third part: neural network for occupancy model (simple)

Fourth part: recurrent neural network occupancy model (testing effects of missing data).

All under development...
